Tinker
------


Chef DataBag comparison tool.

## What is Tinker?

Tinker is a tool that allows a use to view and compare Chef databag structures. It is useful in cloud environments that
maintain parallel databag structures with different encryption keys. This allows a deployment to switch out the
encryption key and the databags without changing any Chef attributes or recipes to lookup different databag
coordinates.

## Why Tinker?

Because reasons, but mostly because [The Tinker](http://kingkiller.wikia.com/wiki/Tinker) is a traveling
saleman/repairman in The Kingkiller Chronicles by Patrick Rothfuss and I'm jonesing for the release of the next book.
